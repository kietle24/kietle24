## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm an independent full-stack developer with a passion for creating efficient, user-friendly web applications. In the spirit of contributing to the open source community, I leverage modern technologies to solve real-world challenges and enhance digital experiences. When I'm not bug hunting, you can find me exploring new tech trends or laughing at a programming meme—because coders need to have some fun, right?

## 💼 Experience
- Developed scalable web applications with **React** and **Node.js**, optimizing performance and user experience. (Fun fact: I once reduced load times by 50% and celebrated with a victory dance!)
- Contributed to open source projects with **Python** and **Git**, improving features and documentation. Proudest moment? Fixing a bug that the community had been stumped on for weeks.

- Designed intuitive, responsive interfaces with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Angular** for seamless user interaction. For me, good design is like a good joke—simple, unexpected, and makes you smile.
